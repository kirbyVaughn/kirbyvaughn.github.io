							My name is Kirby Vaughn, and this is the first page for extra credit It is a landing page for
							my git hub.  It was developed for my class ISQA 4900, and I am looking forward to developing my skills
							and learning of how to build dynamic html pages.  I am  a senior, and plan on graduating at the end of the
							semester..</p>

						I have spent 12 years in the Army, and have been married for 20 years, this last May, but
						due to the pandemic, we were not able to celebrate the way I wanted to.  We are blessed 
						to have four children, one of them is a sophmore this year at Howard University.
						my wife is enrolled for her Doctorate at Bellevue Univerisity.  I decided that it was time for me to finish my degree.
